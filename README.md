# dict

A quarkus based CLI tool to do quick translation-lookups (en/de vs de/en) based on [www.dict.cc](https://www.dict.cc)

## Usage 
```bash
./dict running
Term: running

### Using the tool behind a proxy
The CLI tool tries to discover the proper proxy-settings by reading the `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variable (and also supports proxies that require basic auth).
If you're executing the tool outside of a shell-environment or if the auto-discovery doesn't work properly you can hand-over the required proxy settings explicitly via respective options (see `--help`):

```bash
#  in that case I'd recommend a wrapper-bash-function
./dict --proxy-host proxy.muc --proxy-port 8080 running
```

### Output-formats and Alfred integration

The initial reason for me to create that script was an [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com)-Workflow for quick translation that stopped working for me (due to MacOS dropping `python`-support). Hence, the CLI tool supports three output-formats at the moment (one specifically for Alfred).

## Installation

1. Checkout the repository and make sure you have all pre-requisites for compiling to native code
    1. GraalVM (tested with version `22.1.0.r17`)
    2. make sure you can compile to native images with that installation (i.e. `gu install native-image`)
2. next compile the code to native image and generate the binaries using `./buildAll.sh`
3. in the `target` folder you should see now a `dict` binary
    1. move that binary to our `$PATH`
       
## Developement

As already mentioned - this project makes use of Quarkus and PicoCLI to create a native executable.

- used for active development (also use the `e`-key to define and re-execute a specific command)
   ```shell script
   ./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
   ```
    - As picocli applications will often require arguments to be passed on the commandline, this is also possible in dev mode via:
      ```shell script
      ./mvnw compile quarkus:dev -Dquarkus.args='-o alfred running'
      ```
      Also for picocli applications the dev mode is supported. When running dev mode, the picocli application is executed and on press of the Enter key, is restarted.
- Creating a native executable
   ```shell script
   ./mvnw package -Pnative
   ```
    - Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using (produces a linux-binary):
       ```shell script
       ./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
       ```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./target/dict-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner` - it's recommended to rename or define an alias for the final result

### Produce a Autocompletion-Script

In order to generate a auto-complete script you could execute the followin' command:
```bash
$> cd target/quarkus-app
$> java -cp $(ls lib/main | awk '{print "lib/main/" $1}' | tr "\n" ":")../dict-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar picocli.AutoComplete de.bender.dict.boundary.DictCommand
```
I'd like to integrate that into the ordinary build-process (maven based).

## Alfred integration
Although there is already a `dict`-workflow for Alfred I was eager to make my own experiences (for educational purposes mainly).

I've initially provided a `workflow`-definition in this repo as well as an export (as described [in here][workflow-on-github] - out-of-the-box only for Intel-Macs).
